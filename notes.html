    <h2 class = "subtitles" id="basics">Basics of the WWW</h2>
      <p class = "content"> The World Wide Web (WWW) is a mindbreakingly huge network of computers
        spanning the globe. Despite its size and complexity, the web runs mostly
        on variations of just one protocol, <b>HTTP</b>, brought to you by
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">this guy</a>. When
        your computer visits a website, it is making an HTTP request to a special
        kind of computer called a <b>server</b>, just like in the picture below.

  <div class = "layer_three">
    <h2 class = "subtitles" id="languages">Languages</h2>
      <p class = "content"> The websites that your computer accesses over the web are written in a
        number of different languages. Three of the main languages are <b>HTML</b>,
        <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>. The latter two are usually found mostly
        in the header area of an HTML document. In this course we will be learning
        HTML and CSS.

  <div class = "layer_three">
    <h2 class = "subtitles" id="forget">It's OK to forget</h2>
      <p class="content">An old physics professor of mine used to ask students "As a physicist, what are
        you allowed to forget?" The answer was "Nothing." This is NOT the case in
        computer programming, where a google search for the relevant documentation
        can stand in for an eidetic memory.
